  <font size="5">When you love something like reading — or drawing or music or nature — it surrounds you with a sense of connection to something great. If you are lucky enough to know this, then your search for meaning involves whatever that Something is. It’s an alchemical blend of affinity and focus that takes us to a place within that feels as close as we ever get to "home." It’s like pulling into our own train station after a long trip — joy, relief, a pleasant exhaustion. <br> </font><br>

<p>I was a bit reluctant to make this new blog running themed, but I like the idea of examining life through the lens of an activity like running. So I wanted to make this somewhat running-centric, thoughts about the intersection where life and running meet, the lessons running (and sport in general) can teach us about life, and what we bring from our daily lives into our running.</p>

<p>I also want to frame the posts around quotations, because there are inevitably countless writers who have expressed an idea in a way more clear and inspiring than I can hope to.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! As a reward, here is my favourite cute animal video. If you&rsquo;ve never seen a slow loris before, prepare to have your heart melted:</p>

<p class="message"> One of my favourite quotations, from <em>The Eden Express </em> by Mark Vonnegut. For context he's talking about chess. <br> <br>
<font size="4">
 Among amateurs, most "touch-move" games are lost on stupid blunders. The game becomes pointless very early: neither player learns anything. I'm capable of playing a good game of touch-move, but I have a hard time enjoying it. I beat players I should lose to and lose to players I should beat. Either way, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. <br> <br>

  Touch-move fans argue with equal fervor that being able to take moves back ruins the game. It's bad preparation for tournament play, encourages sloppiness. Maybe they're right. Maybe we should be made to face the consequences of our blunders. Cold hard world and all. <br> <br>

  Life is a lot more like touch-move than friendly chess, but maybe that's because there are so many goddamned touch-move players around. <br> <br>

  What I hope is true is that if we go about it the right way, we can take back a lot more than we think we can. If we could all make an effort to let anyone take back anything, if it's in our power to let them take back instead of jumping so greedily at mistakes, we might be able to make life much more pleasant. We might even be able to find a way to go backward in time and patch up what now look like irrevocable blunders. Letting friends take back chess moves would be as good a way to start as any. </font>
