        A Plain Markdown Post
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Dec 30, 2016</span>

    <p>This is a post written in plain Markdown (<code>*.md</code>) instead of R Markdown (<code>*.Rmd</code>). The major differences are:</p>

<ol>
<li>You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (<code>```{r}</code>);</li>
<li>A plain Markdown post is rendered through <a href="https://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/">Blackfriday</a>, and an R Markdown document is compiled by <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com"><strong>rmarkdown</strong></a> and <a href="http://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&rsquo;s Markdown. For example, you can write a task list with Blackfriday but not with Pandoc:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><input type="checkbox" checked disabled class="task-list-item"> Write an R package.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled class="task-list-item"> Write a book.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled class="task-list-item"> &hellip;</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled class="task-list-item"> Profit!</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, Blackfriday does not support LaTeX math and Pandoc does. I have added the MathJax support to this theme (<a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme">hugo-lithium-theme</a>) but there is a caveat for plain Markdown posts: you have to include math expressions in a pair of backticks (inline: <code>`$ $`</code>; display style: <code>`$$ $$`</code>), e.g., <code>$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$</code>.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:This-is-because"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:This-is-because">1</a></sup> For R Markdown posts, you do not need the backticks, because Pandoc can identify and process math expressions.</p>

<p>When creating a new post, you have to decide whether the post format is Markdown or R Markdown, and this can be done via the <code>rmd</code> argument of the function <code>blogdown::new_post()</code>, e.g.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">blogdown::new_post(&quot;Post Title&quot;, rmd = FALSE)
</code></pre>
<div class="footnotes">

<hr />

<ol>
<li id="fn:This-is-because">This is because we have to protect the math expressions from being interpreted as Markdown. You may not need the backticks if your math expression does not contain any special Markdown syntax such as underscores or asterisks, but it is always a safer choice to use backticks. When you happen to have a pair of literal dollar signs inside the same element, you can escape one dollar sign, e.g., <code>\$50 and $100</code> renders &ldquo;\$50 and $100&rdquo;. <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:This-is-because"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>

        Ironman Muskoka Race Report

<p>Poor blog, this must be how you feel after an entire summer of neglect. The writing and computer-y projects I was excited about  before Boston have not been compatible with warm weather, ironman training, and a busier-than-usual summer at work. But shorter days are signaling the demise of summer, and I find myself in a 5-week limbo between Ironman Muskoka and the Chicago marathon - a good time to retool and attend to everything that has taken a backseat to training over the past four months.</p>

<p>The inaugural Ironman Muskoka - this is what it took to snap off the running-only blinders I&rsquo;ve had on since 2009. My nascent triathlon career has been on hold after a disappointing debut at Ironman Florida, followed up a week later with a much better performance at the 70.3 championships which used to be held annually in Clearwater. After that race I felt a huge relief that I didn&rsquo;t have any other triathlons on the books. I could just run, and I remember how wonderfully simple that felt - no pools or bikes required, just strap on some shoes and head out the door. I assumed the desire to train for and compete in tris would come back eventually, if not that summer than the one after. But year after year, I was perfectly content with marathon training. I would bike and swim occasionally and enjoy it, but never did that spark of interest for triathlons return. Only when rumours of a full ironman in Muskoka surfaced did I consider a return to the sport. Muskoka 70.3 was my second half-ironman distance race, and I loved it. Hills are my thing, the course was beautiful and challenging, and placing second in my age group infused my memories of that race with warm feelings of fondness and nostalgia.</p>

<p>I signed up for Muskoka without much thought; it was a year away - plenty of time to prepare. I rode a bit that fall, but after registering for Boston again I put it out of my mind for the winter. I would have four months after Boston to get my cycling up to speed, and I wasn&rsquo;t too worried about the swim. In retrospect I should have been friendlier with my trainer over the winter - it would have been nice cross-training for the marathon and given me a headstart going into the summer.</p>

<p>The weeks ticked by slowly at first as I built up my cycling volume. At the end of May I still felt like I had a &ldquo;ton&rdquo; of time to get ready. Then June was gone, and July was a Sweny-fest with my sisters visiting from Washington state and New Zealand. All of a sudden it&rsquo;s August and I only have two weeks until I should be tapering. I felt a bit panicky at that point, like I hadn&rsquo;t done nearly enough to prepare. Sure I&rsquo;d done some good long rides, but not enough to assuage the intimidation I felt about the ironman distance. With head down I plowed through a nice chunk of volume those last two training weeks, giving me some much-needed confidence going into the race. I&rsquo;ve always been more attracted to training than racing, and nothing undermines my already shaky racing mentality more than feeling like I haven&rsquo;t done everything I could to prepare.</p>

<p>Race week: <em>the</em> most nervous I&rsquo;ve ever been for a race. I was haunted by memories of IM Florida, that most terrible of terrible race experiences. My number one goal for this race - above all else - was <strong>not</strong> to hate it. I didn&rsquo;t want a repeat of my first attempt at the distance, which evidently put me off of triathlons for six years. This wasn&rsquo;t a cop-out goal either, because if I was going to not-hate this race I would have to be not-super-slow. Walking mile after mile in the scorching heat wasn&rsquo;t going to rekindle my love of triathlons.</p>

<h2 id="swim">Swim</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Predominant feeling</strong>: Boredom</li>
<li><strong>Equipment</strong>: Orca Predator 2 wetsuit circa 2004, Speedo goggles of unknown origin.</li>
<li><strong>Food</strong>: None</li>
<li><strong>Lesson learned</strong>: I need to find a way to make swimming fun again.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ah the swim. Swimming and I have a relationship best described by the phrase &ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated&rdquo;. Untold hours of my childhood were spent staring down at a black line, lane-rope at my side, chlorine saturating every pore of my skin. In university I once swam 200km in a week. Just for funsies. It honestly boggles my mind now. I often wonder if I had a finite amount of pool swimming in me, and I just blew through it in the first quarter of my life. Training for this race I waited for the outdoor pools to open, telling myself that would be better, at least I&rsquo;d be outside. I had the best of intentions, going to Moses Springer pool after work - it&rsquo;s as nice a 50m outdoor pool as you&rsquo;re likely to find in Ontario. And it wasn&rsquo;t bad, maybe even pleasant the couple of times I went. But after 2000m I was ready to call it a swim practice. When we rented a cottage for our family reunion I did a bit of open water with my sisters, and that was enjoyable. So perhaps next year I just need to find more ways to get out to the lakes.</p>

<p>Back to Muskoka. The swim was a rolling start, with everyone seeding themselves according to predicted swim time. <strong>SO</strong> much better than a mass start, I loved it. I was right at the front in the sub-hour crowd, and I was among people the whole swim without getting jostled around. I could have made a greater effort to draft off some of the faster guys, but I didn&rsquo;t really feel the need. I was swimming really easy anyway, and my theme for the day was not to focus on the minutia. This was to be a re-introduction to the sport and I didn&rsquo;t want to stress over every little minute here or there. It was a big-picture rather than a marginal-gains kind of day.</p>

<p>Not much else I can say about the swim, other than that I was cold at the end, slightly lamenting my 10-year old sleeveless wetsuit as I lost feeling in my hands. The swim just was - nothing special, nothing exciting. If I can resuscitate my motivation to swim I want to make it more of a race next time, top 3 out of the water or something noteworthy like that.</p>

<h2 id="t1">T1</h2>

<p>A steep little jaunt up to the resort, trying to control my uncontrollable shivering. Big A can attest that I take a certain pride in my physical hardiness. A trip to the grocery store may easily turn into a demonstration of how great I think I am at carrying heavy things.  For some reason it&rsquo;s a point of pride that I can tolerate unpleasant physical conditions, such as how I walk to work every day in the winter, trudging through snow and polar-vortex conditions without issue. In my university swimming days I would happily dive into Lake Ontario in early spring sans wetsuit, the water barely over 60. Now I was a trembling mess after an hour in 69 degree water, <em>with a wetsuit</em>. Clearly I&rsquo;ve lost my edge. Anyway, the transition area was the most well-organized I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Every athlete had their own chair where they put their bike and run transition bags. Brilliant idea. I was the only one in transition when I arrived so it was a nice calm environment. I struggled with my bike shoes because my hands were shaking and numb, and I think I did them up too tight. This would have unfortunate consequences 100km later.</p>

<h2 id="bike">Bike</h2>

<p><img src="./assets/bike.jpeg" alt="Sweet Betty Designs kit!" />{: .center-image }</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Predominant feeling</strong>: Dead heat between joy and bodily pain.</li>
<li><strong>Equipment</strong>: Argon 18 Krypton road bike with aerobars.</li>
<li><strong>Food</strong>: One bonk breaker bar, three bottles Skratch Labs lemon-matcha, 2 honey stinger waffles, some red licorice.</li>
<li><strong>Lesson learned</strong>: Nothing trumps training, but equipment matters. Like, a lot.</li>
</ul>

<p>It took about 15 miles to warm up on the bike and for the vigorous shivering to subside. Being a stronger swimmer than cyclist I get passed by heaps of people on the bike. It&rsquo;s a little disheartening, but I was enjoying the ride too much to care. Plus most of the passing was happening on the flats and downhills, and it made me happy that I could catch most of them on the next little roller before they took off for good. The bike course is an endless sequence of ups and downs, and I loved it. Our group of friends was camped out at the Lake of Bays brewery around 70km, which broke up the two-loop course even more and gave me something to look forward to. The conditions on that first loop were absolutely perfect - cool and overcast, I wasn&rsquo;t thirsty at all and had to remember to drink preemptively.</p>

<p>I was using my fancy new road bike for the race, mostly because it has Di2 shifters and I thought with the hilly course the aero penalty wouldn&rsquo;t be too bad. But I was down in the bars a lot more than I anticipated; bars which I had only purchased a few weeks before. I thought I had tested them out enough, doing a full 180km with them just fine, but after the first loop in Muskoka my back was complaining. This quickly escalated from uncomfortable and annoying to painful and distressing. My second loop splits suffered as I had to coast even the slightest downhill so that I could stretch out my back. In retrospect it was a stupid mistake - I should have been training with the aerobars from day one. With 60km to go my feet joined the choir, in what I can only assume was some sort of grueling duel with my back to see which could cause me the most pain. I loosened the straps on my shoes but the damage had been done and there was little relief. This paints a dire picture, but although I was suffering something fierce it was somehow manageable because I knew once I was off the bike and into some luxuriously cushiony and not-tight running shoes everything would be right as rain.</p>

<h2 id="t2">T2</h2>

<p>My transitions may generously be described as amateurish. I hopped off my bike and tried to run in my bike shoes, which at this point were like small daggers in my feet. I stopped to take them off. I suppose there&rsquo;s a reason people wear tri shoes - it took a good 30 seconds of fumbling to undo them and disengage them from my feet. No sooner had I done so than a volunteer appeared and offered to put them on my bike. I can&rsquo;t say enough about how awesome the volunteers are. Back at my trusty chair another volunteer emptied my bag and I rifled through to grab what I needed. Running shoes on and I was about to head out when I remembered the wristbands we were supposed to give to one of the volunteers throughout the day. More rifling required to find the thing, but the volunteer seemed to appreciate the gesture so it was worth it.</p>

<h2 id="run">Run</h2>

<p><img src="./assets/run.jpeg" alt="Sponge-Bob Rectangle Pants, my trusted ally." />{: .center-image }</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Predominant feeling</strong>: Gratitude</li>
<li><strong>Equipment</strong>: Skechers GoRun 4 shoes</li>
<li><strong>Food</strong>: A few salt tabs and a miscellany of chips, orange slices, red bull, gatorade, pepsi, pretzels and candies. More gratitude for my iron stomach because I needed the calories to make up for my paltry bike consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Lesson learned</strong>: Don&rsquo;t let happiness make you complacent.</li>
</ul>

<p>The run is what made my day. In long endurance events there are always low moments, and the longer the event, the lower your mind can take you. My suffering on the bike was tolerable because I <strong>knew</strong> it was finite. I&rsquo;d dealt with back pain before, and it always vanishes soon after I stop riding. I just had to get to the run and all would be well&hellip; I love running, and I fancy myself a resilient runner. I can run through heat and fatigue and muscle pain - I kept telling myself all I had to do was finish the bike and all would be well.</p>

<p>Mile 1 and the running feels good, cadence is high, I&rsquo;m not too tired. But my back&hellip; not as bad as on the bike, but bad enough to find it disconcerting that the pain hadn&rsquo;t resolved. Probably just needs another mile to loosen up I think. Mile 2 and there is no improvement. Now I am assessing whether I can run for 4 hours with this. I stop, bending over to stretch my back. I can barely get back up. I power walk up the next hill. I am not happy. Husband and company are waiting around mile 4. I head straight to the side of the road and lie down on my back, stretching my legs to my chest to get some relief as I talk to them. Back on my feet and running I notice a cramp coming on in my right quad and I want to cry. In my mind at that moment I was convinced it was going to be a 5 hour death march to finish this race.</p>

<p>I take all my remaining salt tabs and some ibuprofen, something I should have tried on the bike. Gradually my back pain eases, either from the ibuprofen or just naturally on its own. The cramp is still there threatening to undo me so I chow down on everything salty as I walk through each aid station. I also walk up every hill - quad cramps are no joke, and I needed to keep it manageable. When I&rsquo;m running I&rsquo;m running well, passing people and feeling great. The walking is voluntary and precautionary so I don&rsquo;t feel defeated by it, and I don&rsquo;t lose much time on the hills. I can walk uphill almost as fast as those around me are running, and I feel pretty smug that I&rsquo;m conserving energy and saving my muscles. I&rsquo;m smiling and thanking the volunteers profusely, and when I see husband and company again I&rsquo;ve undergone a total reversal of attitude. I&rsquo;m so grateful to be out there running, with people supporting me and rooting for me to do well. The ability to go from being completely dejected and ready to give up on any hope of performing well to that kind of happiness and elation is what I love most about endurance races. I feel like in a long race there comes a point where you don&rsquo;t have as much control over the physical aspect, and it&rsquo;s the mental side of things where you can really make a difference. Proper nutrition and pacing can help you avoid bad outcomes, but once something goes wrong it becomes a psychological battle to tough it out. I suppose the same kind of thing happens in short races, but in an abbreviated form.</p>

<p>I was really pleased with how I executed the run. My only regret would be in the last 10km. I was still feeling relatively good and my leg cramp hadn&rsquo;t progressed beyond the original niggle. I could have pushed it at that point and tried to pass a few more girls, but I was just so happy to have turned the race around that I didn&rsquo;t have that competitive drive. I played it safe and continued walking up hills and through aid stations right to the end. My legs were toast when I reached the finish line so maybe it was the wise choice, but I still wonder if I might have left something out on the course.</p>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>

<p><img src="./assets/postim.jpeg" alt="Celebrating with my biggest fan." />{: .center-image }</p>

<p>This was an amateur-only race so I was able to sneak into the top 10 overall, 4th in my age group. Going into the race I&rsquo;d considered that there might be the possibility of a Kona spot, but there were some stand-out girls in my age group with a lot more experience (apart from a sprint in Bermuda my last triathlon was 6 years ago). I didn&rsquo;t think I cared that much about getting a spot - it would be an expensive trip and probably not my kind of race - but when I was up there and it rolled down to 3rd, I must admit to being more than a little disappointed. The overall and AG winner turned down her spot, and when it came down to the 3rd place girl she asked why, and it was because she was already going this year. Third place girl replied that she too was going this year, and in an entirely irrational reaction I was annoyed by this. She has every right to claim a spot for next year, and I might do the same thing if I were in her shoes. Nonetheless it sparked a little competitive fire in me, and I&rsquo;m now determined to race another one and see what I can do. I&rsquo;m going to do it right this time - get a coach, train through the winter, get my equipment squared away, do some warm-up races and really put my heart into it. With the exchange rate being what it is I&rsquo;m thinking of sticking to home soil with Mont Tremblant. Only 349 days to go!</p>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Jan 1, 0001</span>

    <p>I felt a sense of relief on many fronts this week. Last week was my peak long run distance (24 miles), my highest volume of running ever, and my first time over 100 miles. It also marked the first break in winter, with some positively gorgeous weather on Sunday. I had two easy runs on the schedule, and sometimes that second one can be something of a drag when I really just feel like putting my feet up after a long run and a long training week. But with the sun warming my back and the freedom of only a single layer of clothes it was anything but arduous.</p>

<p>With less than 6 weeks to go until Boston I&rsquo;m more than <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> through the training program, and my mindset has unconsciously switched from wanting to maximize my training to a more cautious approach. The hay is in the barn so to speak, and the trade-offs of aggressive mileage are less favourable. The incremental benefit of running when I&rsquo;m tired or achey is now overshadowed by how much I would lose from an injury. I&rsquo;ve been walking the edge of my current capacity this season, that paper thin line between maxing out my abilities and breaking down into a heap of stress fractures and grumpiness. With the bulk of marathon training under my belt, having maintained consistency through a couple of peak busy times at work, and with winter slowly receding I&rsquo;ve felt a lightness this week that I didn&rsquo;t realize was missing. Maybe I was plowing through some months with my head down, focused on just getting through work weeks and workouts, not realizing that I was perhaps holding on to the reins a little too tightly. Maybe that&rsquo;s how it had to be done; I don&rsquo;t have a good track record of training through the winter, and maybe I needed some blinders on to get outside on those cold, dark mornings when I knew I had a busy day of work ahead of me.</p>

<p>Either way, I feel like I can let go a bit now and loosen the grip. I got through a 103-mile week none the worse for wear, and followed it up with some solid runs this week. With any luck there won&rsquo;t be any more face-numbingly cold mornings I have to grit my teeth for, and my willpower can take a back seat and replenish its stores. Taper is just around the corner, the snow is melting, the days are getting longer, and I&rsquo;m increasingly excited to see what I can do on race day. There is much to be thankful for.</p>

        Rest

    <div class="message">
  "Activity and rest are two vital aspects of life. To find a balance in them is a skill in itself. Wisdom is knowing when to have rest, when to have activity, and how much of each to have. Finding them in each other - activity in rest and rest in activity - is the ultimate freedom.” Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Celebrating Silence: Excerpts from Five Years of Weekly Knowledge 1995-2000
</div>

<p>I&rsquo;m dealing with a little foot injury right now, and after a huge block of consistent training I struggled at first with having to take some time off. But a few things have helped me become more relaxed about this otherwise undesirable necessity.</p>

<p>1) <strong>The weather</strong> Winter training is always accompanied by a compulsive checking of the Environment Canada weather service, anticipating how cold it&rsquo;s going to be today, tomorrow, for the rest of the week. Since you have to adapt your training to fit the conditions (e.g. no speed work when the sidewalks are skating rinks) it&rsquo;s vital to stay up-to-date on the changing forecasts. Funnily this preoccupation with the weather is the same when I&rsquo;m <em>not</em> running. It&rsquo;s a case of fear-of-missing-out. If the weather is terrible I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m missing out on some really great, inspiring runs; I&rsquo;m only avoiding some tough, possibly miserable, probably unpleasant ones. Sometimes these can turn out to be inspiring workouts in their own way, but there&rsquo;s some comfort in knowing that I&rsquo;m not missing an amazing trail run at dawn in beautiful spring conditions.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Alternatives</strong> When my training volume increases I sometimes feel a bit of anxiety about how all-consuming it becomes. While the time requirements of a mileage increase alone aren&rsquo;t huge, it also comes with an increase in the auxiliary exercises like food preparation, stretching, strengthening, foam rolling etc. Other self-development projects can easily get pushed aside, and being able to once again pursue these in earnest is a nice side-effect of this involuntary running break. I&rsquo;ve been meditating and working on yoga poses every day, learning to code (better) in Python, writing and reading more. It&rsquo;s a more balanced existence, where my life isn&rsquo;t focused entirely on improving one thing.</p>

<p>3) <strong>Rest</strong> Coming off some huge mileage weeks, I&rsquo;m confident that a small break from running is in my best interest. I may lose a little bit of that hard-earned fitness, but I have no doubt this will be made up for in the mental and physical freshness I&rsquo;ll have when I come back. Slogging through some big weeks in less than ideal conditions can take it&rsquo;s toll on my desire to run. Some cold, dark, snowy, windy mornings I&rsquo;ve needed a concerted exertion of willpower and contemplation of my long-term goals to get me out the door. Nothing lights up my enthusiasm for running like not being <em>able</em> to run. Can&rsquo;t having something always makes us want it more.</p>

<p>4) <strong>Perspective</strong> My recent thoughts on this warrant their own post, but I&rsquo;ll sum them up in a paragraph. Taking a broader perspective always calms my anxiety, whether about training related things, job stress or anything else. This past week I&rsquo;ve started every day with an assessment of my foot. How much does it hurt? Is it better than yesterday? Can I run today? If I let them, these become the most important questions I face every morning; and if I let them, they would overshadow the rest of my life. They could easily run amuck as I worry and obsess over the uncertainty about how long I&rsquo;ll need to take off. Stepping back to see just how narrow that focus is snaps me back to reality. This injury will not matter much when it comes to my whole life, and my life will matter even less when it comes to the whole world, and what does the whole world matter when you think about the universe? And what if there are infinite universes? There is no end to the insignificance of this one thing in my life that I&rsquo;m letting overrun my brain. On a recent road trip we listened to a podcast with an astronomer, and the discussion about questions of civilizations, infinities and alternate universes reminded me of how comforting our insignificance can be, and how important it is to maintain the right level of perspective.</p>

        Schrödinger&#39;s Stress Fracture
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Jan 1, 0001</span>

    <p>It&rsquo;s incredible what a week off from running can do. On the one hand I feel like I have so much energy I want to run 50 miles at marathon pace, while on the other my body seems to have forgotten all movement patterns associated with running. I used to experience this with swimming all the time - a couple of missed practices due to illness and my feel for the water vanished, at least for a day or two.</p>

<p>I felt a bit of quad soreness on my easy Tuesday morning run last week, cut it short and decided to take the next day off. Unexpectedly I was much more sore the next day, and I was more than a bit concerned that this was a stress fracture. Granted any pain in the general vicinity of my previous stress fracture raises this alarm, but there were enough similiarities with how I remember it feeling to be disconcerting. Five-years-ago-Andrea would have ignored these trifling pains and continued to run, but luckily I&rsquo;m more wise -  if not less headstrong - than I was back then. Looking at my training log from that time, there are three weeks where every entry contains some mention of the state of my upper leg, from mildly annoying to debilitatingly painful. It seems crazy to me now that I continued to run through it, 20-milers and all, but I&rsquo;m going to blame such delusions on my 15-year injury-free swimming career.</p>

<p>Back to the current time, I was satisfied that a seven day break was more than conservative, so I ventured out for a tentative test run on Wednesday morning. I must admit I was fairly anxious about it, being both eager to find out if it was &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;, and deeply worried that it was, in fact, something.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like Schrödinger&rsquo;s cat, the thought experiment in which a poor little kitty is placed in a box, rigged with poison set to release when a radioactive atom decays. Kitty&rsquo;s fate is tied to a quantum system, which the theory goes can exist in a superposition of multiple states until it is observed. There are various experiments of which I&rsquo;m not smart enough to speak indicating that photons traveling through an apparatus of slits and beam splitters can behave like a particle or a wave depending on whether or not we observe their path. The mere act of observing collapses the state of indeterminacy into one of the possible outcomes. I think Schrödinger was trying to highlight the absurdity of this notion by translating it to a macro level; if the quantum system is in a state of superposition, and box-cat&rsquo;s survival depends on this state, then box-cat himself will be simultaneously dead and alive until we open the lid to find out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/062309/schrodingers-present.gif"><img src="./assets/schrodingers-present.gif" alt="Schrodinger's Birthday" /></a>{: .center-image }</p>

<p>In the same way I felt that until I tested out my leg on a run I could hang out in a limbo of being both injured and not-injured. I didn&rsquo;t want to open up the lid and find a dead cat, or in this case feel a pain that would be unmistakeable as a stress fracture. That&rsquo;s pure irrational silliness of course, but I was reluctant to sacrifice all hope of running Boston.</p>

<p>Two runs and 10 miles later and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s nothing, but I&rsquo;m less worried about it being a stress fracture for the moment. I have a mental checklist of everything I remember feeling with the stress fracture, and I can&rsquo;t help starting each day with a short assessment of how many criteria this current injury satisfies or violates. I&rsquo;m subjecting big A to unnecessary drama as my outlook swings from &ldquo;let&rsquo;s order some crutches&rdquo; one day to &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll run tomorrow&rdquo; the next. This alone is reason enough to book an appointment with a sports med doctor as soon as possible, if only to save him from this barrage of contradictions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fond of the strategy of contemplating the worst-case scenario when there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s worrying me. I think I first read of this in Oliver Burkeman&rsquo;s book <em>The Antidote</em>.  If you imagine the worst possible outcome, and how you would cope with it and carry on in its aftermath, then any other realization will also be manageable. Sometimes the worst case scenario may be truly awful, but other times you may find it&rsquo;s actually not that bad, and the initial worry was largely unfounded. In my case there are three general outcomes:</p>

<ol>
<li>My injury resolves itself completely in the next week or so, I continue running and am perfectly healthy when I toe the line in Boston.</li>
<li>I feel better in time for the marathon, but not confident enough to really push it. I run the race for fun and head down to Buffalo in May for another shot.</li>
<li>Despite my awesome powers of self-diagnosis, it turns out I do indeed have a stress fracture, or some other serious injury that requires substantial time off. Boston is out, and I spectate rather that participate. We have a nice vacation, I focus on cycling or swimming for a while and then slowly build my way back for subsequent races.</li>
</ol>

<p>Option 3 is far from terrible. I have a hard time feeling sorry for myself with that as my worst case scenario. I&rsquo;ll allow myself a little bit of disappointment if I&rsquo;m not able to run Boston, but I&rsquo;m forced to cut it short of anything close to self-pity. The worst outcome in this case is less like a dead cat than one with a mild case of the sniffles.</p>

<p>Without any coordination, big A and I started our runs at the same time down to the minute, and went the same distance down to a tenth of a mile. Clearly we possess some sort of supernatural marital running synchronicity.</p>

    <p>The first races in the local running series took place last weekend - the aptly named Re-Fridgee-Eighter 8 mile and 8 km races. These are fun, non-standard distances and I signed up for the 8 miler. This was the first race shorter than a half-marathon I&rsquo;ve done in a while. To be honest I&rsquo;m a little frightened of shorter races - I find the prospect of really hard running more daunting than the challenge of longer distances. For me the marathon is still about overcoming the distance, of not slowing down in the last quarter of the race. That comes with its own unpleasantness, but for me the mental effort of willing myself to keep going in the final miles of a marathon is preferable to the effort required to keep going <em>fast</em> in shorter races. That being said the 8 miler was a lot of fun, and it&rsquo;s nice to feel stronger after having completed a race rather than the worn-down and totally depleted post-marathon state.</p>

<p>I used some of the techniques from meditation to keep focused - checking in with my body to see what was going on, identifying the individual feelings and not letting them overwhelm me. That feeling of wanting to stop can be vague, a mish-mash signal from the central nervous system that&rsquo;s a combination of mental, cardiovascular and muscular fatigue. I found it was useful to call out the very specific things going on in the body, breaking down that general feeling of exhaustion into its components. Like one of my favourite quotations from Henry Ford - <em>&ldquo;Nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small jobs.&rdquo;</em> This is something of a mantra for me in many aspects of my life, be it tackling a complex project at work, or staring down a disastrously messy kitchen. Break everything apart into atoms, units of work that can&rsquo;t be divided any further, and deal with them one by one.</p>

<p>Applying this during a race or hard workout, this can be taking an objective assessment of all that&rsquo;s going on in your body, identifying and naming the various pains and unpleasant feelings and dividing that overall signal of wanting to stop into its constituents. And most importantly, acknowledging that you can deal with each of those pieces - they&rsquo;re not going to kill you. This race was great mental training for me, and I felt like I was able to push the edge of my comfort zone out a little bit. Since I&rsquo;ve toed the line but haven&rsquo;t really <em>raced</em> anything in over a year, it was good to be reminded of how that feels. Also Big A was there to offer me some helpful race tips:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check shoes for gravel before putting on.</li>
<li>Do some stride outs to warm up.</li>
<li>Get as close to the front of the start line as you can (or is reasonable).</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t overdress.</li>
<li>Scrunch up your bib slightly before putting it on. Make sure it&rsquo;s straight.</li>
</ol>

<p>I love having short hair - it requires a mere 90 seconds of attention each morning and has reduced my shampoo consumption at least ten-fold. The only drawback is it requires more frequent haircuts - every 4-5 weeks if I’m to avoid that perpetually disheveled, unkempt look. This week was a haircut week, and my next one is booked for April 13th - the week before Boston. This was my roundabout way of saying that the Boston marathon feels like it is bearing down upon me with break-neck speed. In the time it takes for my hair to grow less than an inch I will have exhausted all of my remaining opportunities to train and be comfortably into the last few days of taper.</p>

<p>The proximity of an event can sometimes feel binary to me. Something is either far enough away that there are ample opportunities to prepare, or it’s so close that I can do little but resign myself to the inevitable outcome. Unsurprisingly I am most relaxed and happy in the former state. I’m a starter of things - to big A’s amusement/bafflement I have numerous  partially used notebooks that I’ve purchased, opened to a fresh page and dutifully populated to 25-50 percent capacity, only to prematurely abandon in favour of another pristine, untouched notebook. I am most comfortable when events - be they work- or sport-related -  are tiny specks on the time horizon. I love signing up for a big race well in advance. The click of a registration button for next year’s race manifests a blank slate of training potential. Yet the weeks tick by inexorably, and something that once seemed so far off and abstract becomes increasingly concrete day by day. The possibilities shrink, and reality is contracted almost to a point, like a sleeping bag stuffed into an impossibly small case. On race day there’s nothing you can do but execute. You show up with the fitness that you’ve put in, and there’s no way to change that. One cannot, alas, conjure up intervening time out of thin air.</p>

<p>I love the process of training much more than the execution of racing. I delight in the methodical progression of fitness and the gradual increase in capabilities. I was always so tense competing at swim meets in my youth - I disliked the idea that the ultimate value of all the hard work I put in and the countless hours in the pool was to be determined by the outcome of  a race lasting only a few minutes at best. So little time to rectify any mistakes; so little margin for error. In the 100 fly let’s say, a too-long glide into the turn could spell disaster: a coveted best-time narrowly missed. And though training helped reduce the likelihood of such technical errors, the short races never sat well with me. Give me a marathon over a 5k any day.</p>

<p>As in sports so in life - I have a tendency to view the progression of time as a narrowing of prospects, and I feel uneasy about any life choice that I perceive as overly limiting. I like to leave as many doors open as I can (with the great exception of partner-selection: with that I am utterly content to confine myself in a hermetically sealed room, to extend the analogy). You might think this mindset would leave me racked with regrets, but this is not the case. Regret is something slightly different. It is a wish to undo what has been done, a dissatisfaction with the road taken. Whereas this feeling is more of a mourning for the roads not taken, no matter how lovely is the road currently under your feet. Even if I am unabashedly happy with how my decisions played out (as for instance with the circuitous way in which I backed into my profession) I still feel a plaintive longing for all the possibilities snuffed out and left un-pursued.</p>

<p>With the pages of my Boston training 75 percent filled, I’m resisting the temptation to start a new mental notebook. Too often I look ahead to the next race well before the finish line of my current goal. This year is even more testing, as my explicit focus is on Ironman Mont Tremblant. And while I’ve been doing marathon-specific training in the lead-up to Boston, I’ve been more in a triathlon headspace this winter than any time since my halcyon days in the sport. While it’s unlikely I’m going to quell my excitement about getting back into more Ironman focused training, I’m trying also to keep my attention squarely on Boston. This has been an interesting marathon training cycle, with much lower run volume and much <em>much</em> shorter long runs than I would typically do. With only one haircut between me and Boylston street, now is the time to put the finishing touches on training and look forward to whatever happens on race day.</p>

    <p>I’m starting to feel like one of those forlorn sailors from old-timey days, shipwrecked in some god-forsaken land without food, beginning to seriously contemplate cannibalism as their compatriots&rsquo; limbs start to more closely resemble juicy chicken drumsticks than fleshy appendages.</p>

<p>Day 10: Still hurts. More elliptical. I wonder how difficult it would be to smash this thing? Where are those old golf clubs we have… But I jest - I truly don’t mind the elliptical. The one and only leg up that indoor/stationary training has on outdoor activities is the ability to watch TV. I’ve blown through House of Cards and am well into the third season of The Americans now. This injury has lifted my TV-watching game to another level. Too bad there is zero practical value to this achievement. Maybe I should start watching some documentaries.</p>

<p>Speaking of documentaries - we watched Blackfish on the weekend. Sad sad sad, for both the whales and the humans involved. I’d never given it much thought before, but it seems crazy that trainers would swim around in a tank with multiple orcas. The possibility of an accident, let alone an act of aggression by a cooped-up, stressed-out whale, seems like an unreasonable risk. I feel about this the same way I feel about free solo rock climbing - no matter how mind-blowingly skilled you are (e.g. Alex Honnold) there always has to be something you can’t control for, some element of chance that no amount of skill or preparation can account for. A piece of rock that becomes unhinged at precisely the wrong time, or in this case a whale executing a maneuver a few seconds early. I’m on the living-in-a-bubble side of risk aversion, so these kinds of risks seem crazy to me.</p>

<p>Back to injury-land. As usual when I get injured so close to a race, there’s a volatile cocktail of anger, self-pity, frustration and regret brewing just below the surface. Every one of those emotions is totally overblown and irrational of course, so it’s a mind game of whack-a-mole trying to suppress them as they arise with more reasonable, less crazed thoughts. Who am I angry at, myself? Maybe. The running gods? Silliness. Self-pity is laughable - I have an injury that prevents me from doing exactly one thing that I like to do, woe is me. Overlooking the countless people with actually real health problems, there’s a runner in my company who was one good race away from making the Olympic standard (which essentially meant he would automatically go), and he recently found out he has a stress fracture in his foot. Worst case I don’t run Boston this year, and I have to wait exactly one year for the opportunity to repeat itself. I’m not missing the Olympics so let’s keep things in perspective.</p>

<p>Moving on to frustration and regret, the two most persistent little mole-heads. Frustration because I’m doing everything I can to get better. I’m a good little convalescent, not even tempted to run again until it’s pain-free, doing whatever mobility and strengthening exercises I can, yet still it improves at a snails pace. And regret because there were warning signs, however small and easily-dismissed at the time. Two runs with tight and achey lower legs that I assumed were run-of-the-mill training soreness. And a long run that felt good but was probably what did the most damage. Maybe if I had taken a break at the first sign of soreness I could have avoided the hot mess my lower leg is in right now… or maybe the damage was already done at that point. We’ll never know. Frustration at the rate of improvement and regret at missing a potential chance to nip it in the bud are both futile feelings. I cannot change the past and I cannot magically accelerate the healing process. As this amazing decorative duct-tape I have reminds me - DILL WITH IT!</p>
